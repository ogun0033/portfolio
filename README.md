# portfolio
*This Portfolio was designed using HTML and CSS while following the standards of W3 school.*

**Below are some of the essential steps taken to build the Webpages**

1. **Responsiveness:** Bootstrap, a responsive framework was used to style the page and a screen breaking point of 768px was set as well using media query '@media screen and (min-width: 768px)'

2. **Accessibility:** The website was designed using accessibility techniques such as;
    - Setting Focus state
    - Using appropriate input type for the contact form such as email, text, etc.
    - Ensuring images have alt text.

3. **Animation:** Pages, images and elements were animated by setting keyframes and using animation, transition and transform settings on them. 

4. **Grids and Cards:** Bootstrap grids and cards were used to style the About and Portfolio pages. These helped the [ages to look organized, professional and ensure responsiveness.

5. **Font Icon:** Font Icons sources includes;
     - [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
     - [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons)
     - [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/)

6. **Font Family:** Google Font Families; Josefin sans, Sanserif and Handlee, Cursive were the fonts used for styling the page.
    I used Handlee for the homepage's main section because the font looks like a human handwritten text and the section I used it for contained a brief information about me which I felt the font would help speak to the users of the portfolio as they would be able to relate with the font.

7. **Image:** Image for the banner was sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/macbook-on-table-3184450/)

8. **Validation:** The HTML Documents of the website was validated using [W3C Markup Validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) and the CSS was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

9. **Reading Resources:**

    - [W3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Challenges
The major Challenge I faced during this project was getting the layout which is made-up of a fixed vertical sidebar and the main content on the right to be aligned and function correctly.
After searching several online resources, I was able to get help my my Professor.

## Lessons Learnt
Using Bootstrap for this project helped increase my knowledge about the framework especially Bootstrap grid, Navigation and adding toggle button to navigation. Though I wanted to give-up on my choice of layout which is a vertical fixed bar,getting help form my professor helped me fix my issues and I know if I was to design a similar project in the future, it will be easier.
